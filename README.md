# Pattern library: “Design Systems Within Reach”

A simple pattern library for demo purposes, created for Ethan Marcotte’s courses for Aquent Gymnasium. Powered by [Fractal](https://fractal.build/).

## Setup

Once you’ve cloned the repo:

1. In the repo root, run `npm install`.
1. Then, run `npm run start`.
2. Then, when prompted, point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/` to view the pattern library. (Note that the URL _may_ be different for you; the terminal will tell you the address that best suits your computer.)

## File structure

The entire pattern library is housed inside `src/`. Static assets can be found inside the `public` folder—specifically, under `public/assets/`.

If you’d like to browse the patterns themselves, those are located under `src/patterns/`.
